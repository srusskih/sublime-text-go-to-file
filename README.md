Note:

This plugin has some differences that the original: See here: https://github.com/stvkoch/sublime-text-go-to-file/compare/gs:master...master


Sublime Text Go To File
=======================

Overview
--------
Plugin searches for a file under the cursor and opens it in new tab.
(The idea comes from Vim `gf` functionality as I missed it in Sublime Text and also the script found on https://gist.github.com/jbjornson/1186126 written by @jbjornson helped a lot!)

Additional functionality - printing currently opened file path in status bar and copy it to clipboard.

Usage
-----
Add shortcut to your keybindings:

    {
      "keys": ["alt+d"], "command": "go_to_file",
      "keys": ["alt+i"], "command": "file_info"
    }

You can highlight the text using `cmd+d` and press `alt+d`.

Press `alt-i` to get info about currently opened file.
